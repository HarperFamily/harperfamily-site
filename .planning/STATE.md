## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Vanilla JS libraries only — site has no framework; adding one would be heavy and unnecessary
- Justified rows over masonry — better fit for photography, clean edge-to-edge rows
- Lightbox on all images site-wide — consistent experience; every image becomes viewable full-screen
