A special conference organised by the Kilkenny Archaeological Society as part of The Gathering. The event is taking place over the 3 days prior to the Harper Reunion and might be of particular interest to some of our foreign visitors wanting to make the most of their stay. There will be a number of lectures taking place in historical venues around Kilkenny and guided tours.
