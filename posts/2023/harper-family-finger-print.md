As an artist, I had the honour of collaborating on a unique art piece at The Harper reunion in April 2013. The project was inspired by the Harper family's Christian heritage, and the idea of unity through faith, love and commitment to one another. The art piece was created by collecting fingerprints from each family member and combining them into a cohesive design. Each fingerprint is unique and represents everyone’s individuality and personal history, and together they created a beautiful and meaningful work of art.

The process of collecting the fingerprints was a bonding experience for the family. As each person added their fingerprint to the piece, they were able to reflect on the significance of their heritage and the importance of family unity.

The final product is a visual representation of the family's combined identity. It also showcasing the value of the individual and the power of coming together as one to create a piece of art that not only represents a time and place, but something that will be treasured for generations to come.

I decided to use the fingerprint as the starting point of the peace as it is a uniquely personal mark that each family member could make easily whether young or old. Collaborative art pieces can be a challenge as they require careful consideration of each person’s contribution and how they will fit together into the final piece. In this case, the fingerprints were the perfect medium to represent the individuality of each family member while still creating a cohesive design.
As an artist and member of this special family, I was thrilled to be a part of this project. Ultimately, I believe that this collaborative art piece serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of family and unity and is a witness of the Harper family's commitment to their faith and their love for one another.
