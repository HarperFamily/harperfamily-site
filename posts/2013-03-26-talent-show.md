**Saturday 6th at 7pm**

We're going to see if there actually is any talent in our family. But don't worry there's no big red buttons or Simon Cowell!

The talent show is always a highlight and it's amazing to see the talent that comes out of the woodwork! But to have a talent show we need some people with talent!

Are you a musician, actor, storyteller, poet, comedian,Â ventriloquist, stuntman, dancer, snake charmer, pro-wrestler, juggler, plate-spinner or fire-breather? If so we want you. To be honest even if you can do anything remotely entertaining we want you! So get in touch with Gareth using the contact form below.
