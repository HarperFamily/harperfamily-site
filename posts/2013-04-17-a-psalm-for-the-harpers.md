What started out as a joke on Facebook about someone writing a (tongue-in-cheek) Harper anthem eventually led to the writing a beautiful worship song inspired by the strong Christian faith that has remained an important part of our family. The song was written by Dave Shaw and first performed at the talent show during the 2013 Reunion. It was a big hit and was sung at the end of our Sunday morning worship service the following day.

Here is a recording of the song by Dave Shaw & Gwin Munt. Thanks to Brian Alcorn for recording and editing it.

> Lord, how Your mighty hand has blessed us
> Your outstretched arm persistent to protect us
> Whether harvest or drought
> With much or without
> You are in our midst
> Lord, throughout the generations
> You have shown Your faithfulness and patience
> When our foolishness fails
> Your wisdom prevails
> We remember this
> We thank You for Your blessings on our family
> You made us and You gave us our identity
> Spread across the nations
> May the light of Your salvation ever burn
> Bright in us
> Lord, You've vowed You'll never leave us
> When we pray, we know that You will hear us
> With our lives in Your hands
> We trust in Your plans
> Jesus, lead us on
