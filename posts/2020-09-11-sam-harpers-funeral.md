Today we celebrated and thanked God for the life of Sam Harper of Sandford's Court, Kilkenny at his funeral service in the Presbyterian Church, Kilkenny. Sam passed away on September 4th, 2020 just a few weeks before his 100th birthday. Sam was a man of deep character, integrity, humility, humour and faith and will be dearly missed.

Our sympathy and prayers are with Dougie, Albert and Margaret Harper, Dorothy and Harry Smith, Beryl and Gordon Harper, David and Mary Harper, and all the grandchildren and great grandchildren and all who will miss his sparkling eyes and beautiful character.

Due to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions only a maximum of 50 people could attend the service in person. So while many people couldn't be there in person they joined in watching a live video feed from outside the church building and around the world through Facebook.

We were fortunate that Sam was able to take part in the Harper Family Virtual Reunion back in April and so we have a recording of a beautiful message from him that was used in the service.

Many who couldn't attend the service also honoured Sam in their own way. Nigel Smith, the designer behind [The Harper Family Cookbook](http://harperfamily.ie/2019/11/10/pre-reunion-meal-and-photo-shoot/) and Sam's grandson, published a recipe for Sam's favourite meal, encouraging others to cook and share the meal in memory of Sam.

> Hi Everyone! If like me you are unable to be with family right now after Grandad's death and are feeling a little disconnected or are unsure of how to mark this occasion, I would like to share with you this recipe for Grandad's favorite meal and invite you to cook and eat it in remembrance of him. Tomorrow evening we will make this recipe and spend some time sharing memories and maybe sing a couple of his favorite hymns.
