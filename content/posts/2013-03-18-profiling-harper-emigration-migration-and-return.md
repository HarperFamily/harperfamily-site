In recent years, Ireland/ The Harpers have experienced a marked increase in emigration. As part of a project entitled ‘Being a Harper Abroad’, we are trying to explain why. We would very much appreciate your cooperation in developing this project. The information that you give will be treated in the strictest confidence, and will be used for research and entertainment purposes only. Under no circumstances will your details be passed on to a third party (outside of the family), without your prior consent. The survey should take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete, you'd better put on a cup of tea!

It relates to emigration and your plans for the future. The information that we are gathering in this survey will be of great value in understanding issues relating to emigration, migration and reintegration in the past, today and in the future and the attitudes of family like you.

Harpers born on the Island of Ireland who have moved abroad are the primary focus of the survey, Harpers born elsewhere and have moved to another land are welcome to answer and participate in the seminar as it will be interesting to contrast their experiance, however some of the questions may not work, hence the "other" box and the "SURVEY FEEDBACK", question 9 in the 5th section where they can reply to "Is there anything that you would like to add that the survey did not capture?"

If you would like to find out more about our project, please e-mail [rogerdharper@yahoo.ie](mailto:rogerdharper@yahoo.ie) Thank you so much for your participation.
